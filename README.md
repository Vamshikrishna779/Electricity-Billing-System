# Electricity Billing System - Java Desktop Application  

### Overview  
This is a **Java-based Electricity Billing System**, designed to automate the electricity bill calculation process. The system allows users to input their details and electricity consumption, then generates a bill accordingly.  

### Problem Statement  
The goal of this project is to develop a **Java application** that calculates and displays electricity bills based on the number of units consumed. This system is designed to help electricity providers and consumers by simplifying the billing process and making it more accessible and efficient.  

### Features  
- **User-friendly interface** for entering customer details  
- **Automated bill calculation** based on units consumed  
- **Print functionality** for generating and printing bills  
- **Error handling** for incorrect inputs  
- **Simple and effective** Java Desktop Application  

### Tech Stack  
- **Programming Language:** Java  
- **IDE:** NetBeans  
- **GUI Framework:** Java Swing  
- **Database (Optional):** MySQL (for storing billing records)  

### Project Plan  
1. **Install NetBeans IDE** and create a new project named `ebill`.  
2. **Design the GUI** using NetBeans Design mode.  
3. **Implement the logic** to calculate bills based on units consumed.  
4. **Run the project** and test different inputs.  
5. **Print the bill**, displaying the amount to be paid.  

### How to Run the Project  
1. Clone the repository:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/electricity-billing-system.git
```  
2. Open **NetBeans IDE** and load the project.  
3. Go to **Code Area**, right-click the file, and select **Run File**.  
4. Enter customer details and **units consumed**, then click **Generate Bill**.  
5. Print the bill and verify the total amount.
